wishlist:

* rewrite jenkins notices, give blue ocean URLs
  - https://build.dev.storj.io/job/storj-gerrit/1306/ -> https://build.dev.storj.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/storj-gerrit/detail/storj-gerrit/1306/pipeline/
* unfurl gerrit URLs
* auto-link gerrit URLs for syntax 'storj#234'
  * put some emoji next to such URLs to indicate status, and update those later on to keep them accurate with later changes
* auto-assign reviewers on configured projects if none supplied
* delete or edit-to-strikeout lines in reports about changesets that were merged or abandoned
